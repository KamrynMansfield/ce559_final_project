	abstract = {Innovative methods to improve public transportation safety and response mechanisms have emerged due to Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. IoT devices and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning algorithms analyzing visual imagery, are used to create an innovative Automated Injury Detection and Alert System (AIDAS) for public transportation. The proposed AIDAS architecture employs IoT sensors and cameras in buses and trains to monitor and evaluate passengers’ physical health in real time. These sensors can detect unexpected impacts, odd motions, and distressing noises. A strong CNN model trained to detect passenger injury or bodily damage receives live images from the onboard cameras. An automatic alarm process is activated immediately upon injury detection. The closest emergency response teams and transportation system operators get complete event reports, including time, position (by GPS coordinates), and injury type. A quick reaction to accidents with this real-time alarm system might save lives and reduce public transportation injuries. AIDAS’ use of IoT and CNN technology is innovative in public transportation safety. The technology significantly improved emergency response times and reduced unattended injuries in public transport networks. The system’s excellent damage detection accuracy is due to CNNs’ advanced image processing and pattern recognition skills and IoT devices’ sensory inputs. It also addresses privacy issues and the necessity for strong data encryption and proposes solutions. Finally, it analyzes how AIDAS affects public transportation safety and future research and development in this critical field.},

This study focuses on detecting and tracking vehicles within a monitoring system and analyzing near-miss incidents (black spot and unseen area), specifically examining the influence of video quality on detection performance using advanced model detectors (YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv7+CNeB). The experiment employed methods for vehicle detection through the monitoring system. Near-miss detection was conducted using two approaches: manual observation (Social Distancing Monitoring and Bird’s Eye View) and automatic calculation (using DN indicators). Statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, and one-way ANOVA, were applied to compare datasets obtained from these indicators. The study concludes that YOLOv7+CNeB is effective for vehicle detection and near-miss analysis when video quality is considered in system design and implementation. YOLOv7+CNeB significantly reduces the time required to collect evidence from specific roads, provides visual reports, and addresses technical limitations in current algorithms. Future research should explore additional factors contributing to near-miss events, such as road environment, lane changes, and driver behaviours.},

	abstract = {Active transportation is a valuable tool to prevent some of the most common causes of mortality worldwide, but is severely underutilized. The primary factors preventing cyclist adoption are safety concerns, specifically, the fear of collision from automobiles. One solution to address this concern is to direct cyclists to known safe routes to minimize risk and stress, thus making cycling more approachable. However, few localized safety priors are available, hindering safety based routing. Specifically, road user behavior is unknown. To address this issue, we develop a novel handlebar attachment to passively monitor the proximity of passing cars as a an indicator of cycling safety along historically traveled routes. We deploy this sensor with 15 experienced cyclists in a 2 month longitudinal study to source a citywide map of car passing distance. We then compare this signal to both historic collisions and perceived safety reported by experienced and inexperienced cyclists.},

	abstract = {Pulau Pinang has introduced several measures to enhance traffic safety and promote sustainability, including the installation of CCTV systems and the implementation of smart solutions and green technology as part of the Penang 2030 vision, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, despite these efforts, road accidents persist due to non-optimised detection models, incomplete data from manual reporting, and technological constraints in real-time video analysis and predictive modelling. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the YOLOv7+G3HN framework for vehicle detection and near-miss analysis, with a focus on the influence of video quality on detection performance. The research aims to understand how high- and low-quality video inputs affect the accuracy and computational efficiency of detection algorithms. High[1]quality videos resulted in significantly faster computation times for vehicle detection than low-quality videos, highlighting the importance of video resolution in optimising detection processes. Despite the robustness of the algorithm, with no errors detected in both video qualities, higher miss detection rates in low-quality videos suggest that lower resolution may compromise detection accuracy and the effectiveness of monitoring systems. Near-miss analysis revealed that high-quality videos had a lower probability of near-miss occurrences than low-quality videos, highlighting the importance of video resolution for detection efficacy. These findings emphasise the critical role of high-resolution video inputs in enhancing detection accuracy and reliability, advocating for their implementation to optimise vehicle detection and improve road safety. Additionally, YOLOv7+G3HN outperforms YOLOv7 in both accuracy and speed. The study concludes that the YOLOv7+G3HN framework is effective for vehicle detection and near-miss analysis, provided that video quality is considered in system design and implementation.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores how real-time data from public transport services can help to identify and predict sudden braking events in Helsinki’s bus network. Sudden braking is often a sign of risky traffic situations, especially for pedestrians and cyclists. By studying these moments, we can better understand where and when safety issues are likely to happen, and what might be causing them.  

The research uses open data from Helsinki Region Transport (HSL), focusing on vehicle movement and braking patterns over multiple days. By analysing the time, location, and vehicle behaviour during these events, this research aims to detect patterns that show risk areas. Bus location and movement data were combined with weather conditions to detect patterns behind sudden braking. The outcomes are supported with visualizations, such as heatmaps and cluster-based spatial analysis, to highlight risk zones for sudden braking. These insights could help city planners and traffic safety experts make streets safer, especially for those walking or biking. The goal was to predict when and where a sudden braking event might occur. 

The finding emphasizes the importance of using open urban mobility data to improve traffic safety and protect vulnerable road users.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced traffic simulation has emerged as a transformative tool to address these issues by integrating advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and real-time decision-making into traditional traffic management systems. This systematic review evaluates the impact of AI-enhanced traffic simulation on U.S. urban mobility and safety, synthesizing findings from peer-reviewed studies, transportation reports, and government publications published over the past two decades. The review highlights how machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning, and deep learning frameworks are applied to optimize signal control, predict traffic flow, and improve incident response times. Evidence suggests that AI-driven simulations significantly reduce travel delays, fuel consumption, and emissions while enhancing pedestrian and vehicular safety through proactive risk detection and adaptive traffic control. Furthermore, case studies from major U.S. metropolitan areas demonstrate the potential of AI systems to integrate with smart infrastructure and connected vehicles, enabling dynamic rerouting and congestion mitigation strategies. However, challenges remain in terms of data standardization, model scalability, cybersecurity, and equitable deployment across diverse urban contexts. By systematically analyzing the strengths, limitations, and emerging trends of AI-based simulations, this review provides insights for policymakers, urban planners, and transportation engineers seeking to foster safer, more efficient, and resilient mobility systems. Ultimately, AI-enhanced traffic simulation offers a promising pathway toward advancing sustainable urban transportation in the United States.},

	abstract = {This study uses a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based approach to assess pedestrian safety around Jacksonville State University (JSU) by combining vehicle crash data with perception surveys from 111 pedestrians and 97 drivers. The research identifies high-risk areas, explores contributing factors, and recommends targeted safety improvements.
A total of 209 geocoded crash records (2021 to 2024) were analyzed using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) and hotspot analysis in ArcGIS Pro. Crash clusters appeared along Pelham Road North and Mountain Street, marking key vehicular risk zones. Three major pedestrian danger areas were found: (1) Nisbet Street NW and Cardinal Lane NW, (2) University Circle and Trustee Street near Houston Cole Library, and (3) the parking lot behind Martin Hall. These locations were frequently reported as unsafe by both survey groups, reinforcing the GIS findings.
To strengthen the analysis, the study included socioeconomic, behavioral, and temporal survey data. Most respondents were students aged 18 to 24. Frequent device use, walking patterns, and time of day (morning and afternoon) influenced safety perceptions. Driver concerns were also higher during these periods, and near-miss experiences were linked to lower safety perceptions.
A composite KDE overlay combined crash, driver, and pedestrian density surfaces. This revealed spatial overlaps at key campus locations, including the AL 204 and AL 21 crosswalk and the AL 21 and Nisbet Street NW intersection. These locations were jointly identified as high-risk by both groups, though not confirmed in crash records.
The study presents a multi-dimensional GIS framework that combines spatial, behavioral, and temporal data to support safety planning and guide future interventions at JSU.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the effectiveness of nontechnical skills training for the U.S. public transportation executives and its connection to executive competencies, leadership, and, in turn, public safety outcomes. Prior research highlights the importance of nontechnical skills as essential components of executive competency in transit agencies. Extant research also emphasizes the value of transformational leadership, which draws heavily on nontechnical skills, as opposed to transactional leadership, which relies on structured rules. Despite this recognition, nontechnical skills training for transit executives remains limited in practice, even though such training is critical for ensuring safety and organizational effectiveness. Furthermore, there is only limited empirical research that examines how nontechnical skills training influences executive competencies and leadership traits, and in turn, impacts safety outcomes in the public transit industry.
In order to address this lack of context-specific research, this study employs a qualitative research design and conducts semi-structured interviews with 12 transit professionals. A qualitative design is chosen as it is best suited for an in-depth exploration of public transportation executives’ lived experiences regarding the role of nontechnical skills training in enhancing safety oversight. Specifically, the research explored how the executive competency and leadership traits gained from nontechnical skills training impacted transit executives’ ability to ensure public safety and how the executives evaluate the effectiveness of nontechnical skills training. Sentiment and thematic analysis were also applied to identify patterns across participants’ experiences.
Results of this study revealed that accountability, communication, education, emotional intelligence (later integrated into collaboration), and ethical leadership (later integrated into engagement) are the most important for effective transit executives’ nontechnical competencies and leadership. Moreover, transformational leadership, gained from nontechnical skills training, was found to be aligned most strongly with organizational decision-making and improved safety oversight. These findings highlight the importance of integrating nontechnical skills training into executive leadership development programs. This study also found that the outcome-based education (OBE) framework works best with nontechnical training, as it provides a structured way to design learning objectives, evaluate skill acquisition, and determine whether training produces executive competency and transformational leadership that ultimately support public safety in transit organizations.
Taken together, these results contribute to both practice and scholarship. The findings offer implications for policy reform, executive training standards, and outcome-based evaluation, contributing to a broader discourse on executive skills development in the public transportation industry. The study also advances the literature by providing empirical evidence on how executive nontechnical skills development supports safety culture and operational integrity across U.S. transit systems.},

	abstract = {This study introduces a data-driven framework that integrates kinetic energy principles into proactive intersection safety management. Building on the Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA) Safe System for Intersection (SSI) model, this research proposes the Kinetic Velocity Index (KVI), a model calibrated using categorized crash data to better represent the physical dynamics of intersection crashes. Unlike the SSI model, the KVI estimates the probability of fatal and serious injuries (FSIs) at the crash level, simplifying application while preserving alignment with safe system principles. The study used over 900,000 two-vehicle intersection crashes from the years 2013 to 2024. The model was developed using data from Georgia and validated with an external dataset from Massachusetts. The KVI maintained strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.991 in Georgia; R2 = 0.922 in Massachusetts), demonstrating its generalizability. Importantly, the KVI enables proactive safety screening by estimating severity risk even at locations with no prior FSIs, offering a more reliable and risk-oriented alternative to models that rely solely on past crash outcomes, which can be subject to random variation and may not reflect underlying crash risk. It also supports integration with historical data in weighted risk models. Because the KVI is easy to compute, interpretable, and built on physics-based principles, it provides transportation professionals with a more precise and scalable tool for identifying high-risk locations and evaluating the safety implications of design alternatives. Furthermore, the KVI framework is easily adaptable and can be locally recalibrated to reflect regional crash patterns, making it applicable across diverse roadway contexts.},

Recent studies demonstrated that LLM-based methods match or outperform traditional approaches for tasks like human mobility prediction and visual traffic safety analysis. While recent reviews have begun to explore LLM applications in transportation, a comprehensive systematic review covering public transport operations, traffic signal control, traffic forecasting, traffic safety and autonomous driving is still lacking. This is especially important as the field is rapidly evolving, with increasingly capable models emerging, particularly in vision-based tasks. This review paper systematically examines how LLM-based approaches are applied to public transport, traffic signal control, traffic forecasting, traffic safety, and autonomous driving; to identify strengths, weaknesses, trends, and future research needs. We searched Scopus using LLM and transport-domain keywords (2017–2025) from which 90 peer-reviewed articles met our inclusion criteria and were critically reviewed for their use of LLMs, novelty, contribution, and strengths and weaknesses. Despite  the promise of LLMs, they face issues like high computational complexity, hallucinations, poor physical understanding of the real world and lack of standardised benchmarks, which hinder their real-world adoption. We advocate the future research focus on improving LLMs for transport specific tasks, developing better benchmarks and use Agent AI powered by LLM to develop more capable solutions for transport engineering.},

	abstract = {Crowdsourced data refers to data that is collected and shared by a large number of individuals or organizations, often through the use of digital technologies such as mobile devices and social media. The shortage in crash data collection in developing countries makes it difficult to fully understand and address road safety issues in these regions. In developing countries, crowdsourced data can be a valuable tool for collecting crash data and improving road safety, particularly in urban areas where the majority of road crashes occur. This study is the first to develop safety performance functions using crowdsourced data by adopting a Negative Binomial structure model and Full Bayes (FB) model to investigate traffic safety for urban road networks and provide insights into the impact of roadway characteristics. Furthermore, as a part of the safety management process, network screening has been undergone through applying two different methods to rank the most hazardous road segments: Potential Collision Reduction (PCR) method (adopted in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM)) as well as a graphical method using GIS tools to compare and validate. The analysis revealed that segment length, number of lanes, and pedestrian density were significant factors positively associated with crash frequency. FB models with spatial correlation showed better performance in terms of logic and model fit compared to traditional models. The analysis found that both PCR and GIS-based kriging methods effectively identified hazardous segments, with kriging using summation criteria providing more consistent results when validated against PCR outcomes. Recommendations were proposed to improve pedestrian behavior, and control access points and U-turns, based on the observed impact on safety. Lastly, recommendations were suggested for policymakers to ensure safer roads and limitations regarding data coverage and the need for complementary official crash data were highlighted to guide future research.},

This report will support the public transportation industry’s efforts to institute non-punitive ESR as a critical element in safety management systems implementation. The literature review and background research framed the subsequent narrative and findings from interviews with public transportation agencies. For the purposes of this report, the agency that implemented the ESR system determined successful elements. The researchers did not perform a statistical modeling or evaluation method to determine elemental success; rather, success determination stemmed from the implementing agencies. This report also identifies challenges faced through the implementation phases of ESR system deployment, as presented through the literature review and transit agency case studies. Report findings identify benefits associated with wide dissemination of commonly reported hazards and methods to address them, such as the Aviation Safety Reporting System, or the Confidential Close Call Reporting System. There are also recognized benefits in third-party administration and management of ESR systems through reduced likelihoods of associated punitive or retaliatory consequences. Therefore, researchers determined the public transportation industry could benefit from central repository reporting options for hazards and near-miss information aggregation to further support data-driven decision-making. Additionally, industry evidentiary protections would ensure greater reporting. Finally, the public transportation industry would benefit from a non-punitive ESR toolkit or online resource repository that includes samples for agency customization.},

	abstract = {While experience is often the best teacher, learning from precursors is much less painful. The aviation and health care industries have greatly benefited from proactively analyzing and developing measures to address sentinel events and learning from various data sources. Such reflective learning is typical of High Reliability Organizations (HROs) with strong learning cultures. As technology like Positive Train Control increasingly integrates into the rail industry, the resulting data they inevitably produce can provide a wealth of knowledge that can greatly improve safety if the data streams are well managed and not blindly mined. For example, simulators generate data while locomotive engineers use them. During training, such data can indicate weak points where the engineer can improve. Examining such data over multiple engineers can establish general areas of strengths and weaknesses among trainees where instructors can place more or less focus and develop better overall training options. Such data could potentially be used to improve cab design and establish how trains and cab care would operate along a given rail line. This paper will explore the use of data streams from various sources, including those currently used like injury reports, emerging ones like simulation training evaluations and data logs to develop better safety cultures within the rail industry.},

	abstract = {Growth in passenger traffic on rail corridors shared with freight trains, and expanded rail transport of hazardous materials have both increased the imperative to understand the factors affecting railway transportation safety and risk. A source of risk that has received relatively little attention are railroad train accidents that may cause collisions with trains operating on adjacent tracks. These adjacent track accidents (ATAs) occur when one train derails in multiple-track territory and its equipment or lading intrudes onto an adjacent track and strikes, or is struck by, another train operating on that track. This dissertation develops data and a formal analytical framework to evaluate the risk of ATAs.  Using Probabilistic Risk Assessment methodologies such as Fault Tree Analysis, an ATA is divided into its three principal constituent events: the initial train derailment, the intrusion of derailed rail vehicles onto an adjacent track, and the presence of another train on that track that may collide with the intruding equipment. The probability of each event is assessed, the factors affecting those probabilities are identified, their effects are investigated and discussed, and a formal qualitative and quantitative framework is developed into a comprehensive probability assessment model for ATA occurrences.
Particular attention is given to passenger trains because of their expanded operation on shared-use rail corridors (SRCs) with freight train traffic and consequent exposure to ATA risk.  Passenger train accidents are analyzed and the important factors contributing to their frequency and consequences investigated. Derailments and collisions were analyzed to identify and quantify accident causes that have higher frequency and/or severity in terms of casualties to onboard passengers and crew.
Factors affecting train intrusion probability including track center spacing, track alignment, train speed, adjacent structures, elevation differential, and presence of intrusion barriers or containment systems are identified and their effects on intrusion probability investigated. These factors serve as important elements in developing a comprehensive ATA probability assessment model. A semi-quantitative model is developed as a screening-level risk assessment tool for ATAs, accounting for factors affecting the probabilities of the initial train derailment, the intrusion of derailed vehicles onto an adjacent track, and the presence of another train on the adjacent track. 
A quantitative model is developed to estimate the probability of train presence on an adjacent track when and where a train intrusion occurs, which is affected by the frequency and operational characteristics of train traffic on both lines. This model also estimates the probability of an adjacent track collision based on traffic control, intrusion prevention or warning systems, point of derailment, train braking capability, and other factors.
The ATA probability assessment framework results in the development of the Adjacent Track Accident Probability Assessment Model (ATAPAM). The ATAPAM provides a step-by-step procedure to assess the probability of ATAs in both quantitative and qualitative forms. The probability of an ATA on a multiple-track segment is evaluated with a qualitative risk indicator showing additional intrusion risk. A case study of the application of ATAPAM on a hypothetical SRC is presented. The ATAPAM can be used as a tool in a decision analysis framework in which risk mitigation strategies for ATAs can be evaluated based on their effectiveness, implementation cost, and constraints such as budget and other resources.},

Recognizing that safety does not occur in a vacuum, this study also focuses on other system approaches that have been implemented to address safety hazards. These approaches include various technology applications, infrastructure modifications, and other programs and initiatives, such as driver incentive programs and close call/near miss reporting. The research team conducted a literature review; performed a survey of selected transit agencies; and identified and conducted detailed case studies of 11 public transit agencies, selected from the survey respondents based on their responses to the survey. Effective safety management is comprehensive and multifocused in nature. At the case study agencies, safety management methods are often undertaken concurrently or within a period that does not provide agencies the ability to establish, with certainty, that one method or strategy contributed more to improved safety versus another. Successful programs examined in the case studies have been effective because of multifaceted, coordinated efforts to address transit safety. Strategies such as increased or modified operator training, technology applications, infrastructure modifications, and safety campaigns and promotions were often implemented simultaneously. Thus, judging the relative success of one strategy in reducing transit incidents when multiple strategies were implemented concurrently was difficult. Case study participants agreed that the progress toward a mature safety management system (SMS) framework within their agencies would contribute to an overall reduction in transit safety risks.},

Operators were also surveyed on the frequency and nature of “close calls,” with two-thirds of the operators indicating that such incidents occurred at least weekly and most often involved being cut off by other roadway users. Operators endorsed high visibility enforcement initiatives to improve safety, focusing primarily on negligent behavior.

	abstract = {Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern near bus stops along urban transit, where frequent pedestrian–vehicle interactions occur. While prior research has primarily focused on intersections and midblock locations, bus stops have often been treated as secondary contributors rather than as distinct sites requiring targeted safety assessments. This has left a critical gap in understanding how traffic exposure, roadway characteristics, and bus stop design features specifically influence pedestrian crash risks around bus stop locations. To address these gaps, this study develops a comprehensive framework focused on pedestrian safety in the vicinity of bus stops. The proposed approach employs a Random Parameters Negative Binomial–Lindley (RPNB–L) model to account for unobserved heterogeneity and site-specific variability. Using data from 596 bus stops in Fort Worth, Texas (2018–2022), the model identifies that higher pedestrian crash frequencies are significantly associated with increased AADT, elevated boarding activity, and the absence of key safety elements such as crosswalks, medians, and lighting. Conversely, far-side bus stop placement, signalized intersections, sidewalks, and mixed-use development are associated with lower crash risks. Roads near schools and those with speed limits of ≤35 mph show elevated crash risk. To support proactive safety management, the study integrates a Full Bayes-based Potential for Safety Improvement (PSI) metric, enabling the identification of hazardous stops and high-risk corridors. By unifying advanced count-based modeling with strategic risk prioritization, this research offers actionable, data-driven insights for improving pedestrian safety near bus stops.},

The perception of road safety has gained increasing research interest due to its close connection with the behavior of road users. However, safety isn't always as it appears, and there is a scarcity of studies examining the association and mismatch between road traffic safety and road safety perceptions at the city scale, primarily due to the time-consuming nature of data acquisition. In this study, we applied an advanced deep learning model and street view images to predict and map human perception scores of road safety in Manhattan. We then explored the association and mismatch between these perception scores and traffic crash rates, while also interpreting the influence of the built environment on this disparity. The results showed that there was heterogeneity in the distribution of road safety perception scores. Furthermore, the study found a positive correlation between perception scores and crash rates, indicating that higher perception scores were associated with higher crash rates. In this study, we also concluded four perception patterns: “Safer than it looks”, “Safe as it looks”, “More dangerous than it looks”, and “Dangerous as it looks”. Wall view index, tree view index, building view index, distance to the nearest traffic signals, and street width were found to significantly influence these perception patterns. Notably, our findings underscored the crucial role of traffic lights in the “More dangerous than it looks” pattern. While traffic lights may enhance people's perception of safety, areas in close proximity to traffic lights were identified as potentially accident-prone regions.},

	abstract = {The WMATA Close Call Program Report describes the results of the WMATA Close Call Program and its role in improving safety in WMATA operations. Under the voluntary program, employees confidentially disclose safety risks or unsafe conditions to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, which serves as the independent third-party data steward. All reports are evaluated by a peer review team with representatives from WMATA, labor, and BTS, who make recommendations to WMATA management for preventive safety actions to address the identified risks. This report is based on data collected from 2013 to 2024.},
