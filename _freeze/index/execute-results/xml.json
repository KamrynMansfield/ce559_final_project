The main database I search in was Google Scholar with a few search results from the Scotus database. @tbl-search shows the search phrases and results for each database. My initial search resulted in 448 studies. \nTo find the most relevant studies, I had one round of reviewing each study's abstract and title to exclude studies obviously not related. This left me with 90 studies to sort through. I did a second round of review to look more in depth at the remaining 90 studies, and exclude more studies that were not relevant. This left me with the final 28 studies I used in my literature review. \n\nThe criteria I used to determine a study's relevance were as follows:\n\n- Discussion on close call safety reporting systems on public transit\n\n- Discussion on other safety measures taken to proactively avoid crashes on public transit\n\n## Literature Summary\n\n@tbl-lit-review summarizes the findings from the studies by describing the main mode that was analyzed and the safety measure that was used. There were seven studies that focused on close call or near misses, while the rest of the studies focused on other methods to proactively make safety improvements. Three of the studies focused on worker-related metrics, two focused on crowdsourced data, and the rest focused on some type of technological or statistical method to prevent safety incidents. \n\nOne interesting study to point out was @xu_estimating_2024. In their New York study, the estimated the ratio of near misses to crashes in urban areas to be about 1957:1. This study was the closest to quantifying the effects of close call / near-miss data. The rest of the studies were either data summaries or case studies.\n\n## Research Gaps\nWhile there is a lot of recent research being done on technology to detect near- misses, there are hardly any studies that quantify the effectiveness of improvements made as a result of the near-miss data. There is even less research in this area done specifically for publich transit.\n\nIn their study, @buckley_developing_2012 reviewed the close call reporting system implemented by WMATA, but it was only a case study to describe the organizational changes and safety cultural shifts in the agency. Due to the lack in research on the safety benefits of gathering close call data, this study will contribute to the field of transportaiton safety in important ways. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r
